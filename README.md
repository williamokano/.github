# William Okano
Hi, my name is William and I'm a developer, at least I'm trying hard to become one. Nice to meet you.

## Hobbies
Losing at FPS games. I'm so bad at it. Fun fact, I'm PHP certified and got my certification right after my last PHP job, so I never really kind of used it.

## Skills
- PHP (kind of)
- Java (meh)
- Kotlin (:notbad:)
- Javascript (ðŸ‘€)
- Little bit CSS and HTML, but I'm more focused on backend development.

## Languages I Speak
- Almost Portuguese (Brazilian one, not the fake one from Portugal ðŸ˜‚)  
- Somewhat English  
- Bullshit  

That's it.

## Social (mostly/all of them in portuguese)
